                    <p>
                        SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biology, arranged in a
                        configuration similar to that of a computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate
                        earliest known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years. SCP-003-1 is considered
                        sentient but not actively dangerous except under certain conditions.
                    </p>
                    SCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on
                    SCP-003-2 are not part of any known language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns.
                    </p>
                    SCP-003-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the contents of which are mostly
                    inaccessible without risk of damaging SCP-003-2. SCP-003-2 is capable of controlled emissions of
                    radiation, including heat, light, and anomalous radiation types. SCP-003-2 contains an internal
                    power source of an anomalous nature, which appears to have been losing power since several centuries
                    before discovery.
                    </p>
                    It is considered probable that SCP-003-2 was created for the purpose of containing SCP-003-1.
                    Partially interpreted data recovered from SCP-003-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future
                    LK-class restructuring event caused by SCP-003-1.
                    </p>
                    SCP-003 was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears possible that SRV-04 Beta was
                    deliberately contacted by SCP-003-2. Other organizations have also been alerted to SCP-003's
                    existence, possibly by similar means. Despite this activity, SCP-003-2 does not appear to be
                    sentient, based on its lack of reaction to M03-Gloria analysis and procedures. </p>
