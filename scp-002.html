                        Description<br>
                        SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An
                        iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent
                        apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening
                        is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears
                        to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human
                        body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in
                        the room.
                    </p>
                    Reference: To date, subject has been responsible for the disappearances of seven personnel. It has
                    also in its time at the facility further furnished itself with two lamps, a throw rug, a television,
                    a radio, a beanbag chair, three books in an unknown language, four children's toys, and a small
                    potted plant. Tests with a variety of lab animals including higher primates have failed to provoke a
                    response in SCP-002. Cadavers as well fail to produce any effect. Whatever process the subject uses
                    to convert organic matter into furnishings is apparently only facilitated by the introduction of
                    living humans.
